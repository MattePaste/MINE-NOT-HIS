Unity3D CubeMoves game I created with help from Brackeys

Interactive 3D obstacle dodging game.

Key-bindings (a - left, d - right) used to dodge.
Use your cube character to dodge level obstacles.
Once your character either hits a stage obstacle or
falls off the bounds, the level resets.
Gain score based on distance traveled.

Thanks for viewing my project, CubeMoves!
